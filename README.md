## 1. Getting started
Firstly, you have to add an ssh key to your github account. To do so, just execute on the terminal:
```
$ ssh-keygen
```
And press enter to everything.

Then, copy the content on .ssh/id_rsa.pub into your ssh keys on GitHub.

Once you did that you only need to run:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:TsspGit/CodVid19_CIEMAT.git
```
And the project would be copied to your current folder.
